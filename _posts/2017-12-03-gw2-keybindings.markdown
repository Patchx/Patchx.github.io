I've been playing Guild Wars 2 off and on for a few years now and having alot of fun with it.  A while back, I read a great piece by Taugrim on <a href="https://taugrim.com/2011/04/07/guide-to-strafing-movement-and-keybindings/" target="_blank">Why The Default Keybinds for MMORPGS Are Wrong</a> and subsequently, <a href="https://taugrim.com/2012/06/27/guide-to-guild-wars-2-keybinds/" target="_blank">Taugrim's Guide to GW2 Keybinds</a>.  This blog really changed how I approaced the 'action-MMO', and forcing myself outside of the WASD status-norm really helped me move more naturally in-game. 

After experimenting for awhile with different setups, I wanted to give back alittle by describing my own set of keybindings.  Feel free to use these keybinds as a starting point for developing a system that works best for you.

<h3>On Mouse Buttons</h3>

Since the number of mouse buttons varies widely depending on what hardware you are running, I've started with the assumption that you are using a non-gaming mouse with 1-2 extra mouse buttons accessible to you. Obviously, the more buttons you have on the mouse, the more options you will be able to play with in your own setup.  But, this 'bare-bones' setup below should give you a starting point to expand and tweak as you see fit.
