So, I've been playing Guild Wars 2 off and on for a few years now.  Its alot of fun, but for some classes, like the Elementalist and the Engineer, it can be really hard to feel effective in game.  There are a tonne of different tools available to you, and it can be hard to manage your positioning and dodging while also utilizing the right skill for a given situation.

A few years ago, I read a great piece by Taugrim on <a href="https://taugrim.com/2011/04/07/guide-to-strafing-movement-and-keybindings/" target="_blank">Why The Default Keybinds for MMORPGS Are Wrong</a> and subsequently, <a href="https://taugrim.com/2012/06/27/guide-to-guild-wars-2-keybinds/" target="_blank">Taugrim's Guide to GW2 Keybinds</a>.

These guides really helped me improve my game, and so I wanted to give back alittle by describing my own set of keybindings.

<h3>On Mouse Buttons</h3>

Since the number of mouse buttons varies widely, depending on what hardware you are running, I've started with the assumption that you are using a non-gaming mouse with 1-2 mouse buttons accessible to you. Obviously, the more buttons you have on the mouse, the more options you will be able to play with in your own setup.  But, this 'bare-bones' setup below should give you a starting point to expand and tweak as you see fit.
