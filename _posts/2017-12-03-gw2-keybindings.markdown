<h1>Guild Wars 2 Keybindings</h1>

<p class="post-meta">Dec 3rd, 2017</p>

<br>

<p>A while back I read a great piece by Taugrim on <a href="https://taugrim.com/2011/04/07/guide-to-strafing-movement-and-keybindings/" target="_blank">Why The Default Keybinds for MMORPGS Are Wrong</a> and subsequently, <a href="https://taugrim.com/2012/06/27/guide-to-guild-wars-2-keybinds/" target="_blank">Taugrim's Guide to GW2 Keybinds</a>.  This blog changed how I approaced the 'action-MMO' and helped my game immensely.</p>

After experimenting with different setups, I wanted to describe my own set of keybindings.  Feel free to use these settings as a starting point for developing a system that works best for you.

<br>

<h2>On Mouse Buttons</h2>

<p>Since the number of mouse buttons varies widely depending on what hardware you are running, I've started with the restrictive version, the standard two mouse buttons and one mouse wheel/button. Obviously, the more buttons you have on the mouse, the more options you will be able to play with in your own setup.</p>

<br>

<h2>The Action Camera</h2>

<p>This setup makes use of a Guild Wars 2 feature known as the 'Action Camera'.  When Action Cam is enabled, the camera automatically rotates as you move the mouse.  This means that all of the mouse buttons are free to perform actions.  During Action Cam, the left-click performs your standard auto attack, while the right-click selects the target in your reticle.  Because these options are locked-in, the only flexibility with this setup is what to do with the additional mouse buttons.</p>

<p>For the most limited version of the mouse, I've chosen to bind the Mouse3 button to the 'Look Back' command.</p>

<p>The Look Back command is really helpful in PvP for knowing when to dodge enemy attacks.  It's also helpful because it encourages you to look over your shoulder often to see if a troublesome Thief is trying to gank you.  In addition, you can do things like hit a pursuing enemy with an hard cc, or use an 'jump-back' type ability like the Ranger's Quick Shot while still fleeing from the enemy.</p>

<h2>Keyboard Settings</h2>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<br>

<p>The keyboard setting is identical for both Windows and Mac, which is helpful because I tend to switch between the two.  The majority of the time, the ring, middle and index fingers rest on the strafe left, forward and strafe right keys, respectively.  The pinky rests on the Shift key, providing a point of reference for when the other three fingers move to press the weapon skills.</p>

<p>The Shift and Ctrl keys are modifier keys, enabling you to perform more actions in a limited zone of the keyboard.  This means less finger movements, and less losing your frame of reference as you perform a complex skill rotation.  This setup also makes it easy to strafe or circle-strafe with one finger, while shifting another finger to perform weapon or utility skills.</p>

<br>

<h2>My Setup</h2>

<p>I personally use a wired mouse with three thumb buttons.  This setup works fine for me at the moment, and definitely reduces the 'finger-dance' of the more restrictive version above.</p>

<p>I've mapped the Mouse4 button to the 'Swap Weapon' key, which reduces the pinky finger positioning to only the Shift and Ctrl keys.</p>

<p>The Mouse5 key I've mapped to the Jump button, which is helpful on game modes like Stronghold with uneven terrain.  Its also helpful because its one less Shift-modified key I need to keep mental note of during open-world PvE.</p>

<br>

<p>For a gaming mouse with access to multiple thumb buttons, I would modify this setup to move the Profession skills to the mouse buttons.  This keeps your pinky finger firmly planted on the Shift key, helping you not lose your place on the keyboard.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>That's it!  I hope you find that helpful - and let me know if you have any other ideas on on keybind setups!</p>
